    <h1>Reading Reflectings Week 1</h1>
    <h2>Readings: As We May Think - Vannevar Bush & Long Live The Web - Tim Berners Lee
    </h2>

    <p class="new">My condesed reflections of these two readings are both articles talk about progression 
    in there ways. I say this because in Vannevar Bush- As We May Think article he was talking about
    the progression of humans over time with technology and new inventions. Something
    interesting that stood out to me in Vannevar Bush article is that as humans
    we need to be able to collaborate and come together. I agree with this and feel as it is true because
    two minds at work is better than one. In Long Live The Web - Tim Berners Lee he talks about
    the protection of the web and its users as well as the capabilites that it possess 
    if protected it has great promises.Tim Berners similar to Vannevar Bush think web developers, 
    companies, governments and citizens should work together openly and contine to be cooperative
    to protect the web and with this there would be continued improvements. In my opinion these 
    articles although different had there similarities in there ways which made both reads 
    interesting.</p>
