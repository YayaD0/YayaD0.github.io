    <p id="id1"> In John Berger - Ways Of Seeing, one of the things which
        stood out to me during the video which i found interesting was when he said
        to be 'skeptical'. This stood out because 
        the meaning of a image can be changed with the context given without 
        the original author around, it can simply be by zooming in and not showing the whole image,
        with music, or giving a complete whole story that has nothing to do with it.
        Images are easy to manipulate you see it today all over the media and with social
        media seeing something that is not what it really is. John Berger also talks about
        reproduction being like a language and what i think this means in my point of view is there
        are a bunch of languages and we dont understand them all of them but the ones
        we know similar to reproduction of images we give it a language by changing the meaning of
        it by giving it the context we want. Lastly one last thing i would like to mention
        which ties all back to being 'skepical' is when he talks about cameras being everywhere and
        can show stuff without a human being there. With reproduction there is a chance of images losing
        there meaning without the original context and being watered down by new 'languages'.
