    <h1> McLuhan Response & Interactive Button</h1>

    <p> 
        What i got from The Medium is the Massage by Marshall McLuhan is that the 
        medium we choose which can be television, newspapers, social media, podcasts, 
        etc... plays a big part on how the information is received. In the article 
        he compares a television to other mediums such as a radio and how the experiences 
        of the two are different for example a television demands participation and involvement
        in depth of the whole being projecting images at you and engaging you compared to just
        a radio or reading a newspaper. I agree with the medium that you choose is important
        on how information is received because withstuff evolving every day and all
        the different mediums some capture attention better than others, some social platforms
        are perferred more than others so putting this into effect when putting out information
        is important. It is similar to a companies marketing team looking into human psycology, trends,
        and preferences to try and get someone to buy something.
