<h1> Animations </h1>
<h2 class="fadein"> Disney 12 Principles Of Animations Response: </h2>

<p> The text that I chose to read for assignment 6 was Disney's 12 Principles
    of animations. The 3 animations i found interesting in the reading is
    Squash and Stretch and Anticipation. Considered one of 
    the most important discoveries the Squash and Strech animation gives
    movement within a object while it is progressing through motion. This
    reminds me of a bouncing ball when thinking of this animation and i think that
    it is pretty cool that through a computer screen we are able to give this effect
    to objects. One thing i learned about Squash and Stretch is that it considers
    shape or volume like a half filled sacked when making this effect, This way when it
    drops it flattens out and when it is picked up it will strech out.
    I personally never thought of it in this way until this reading
    but when giving consideration to these it helps the effect from seeming bloated.
    Another thing i found interesting was anticipation, it helps prepare
    the veiwer as things unfold. Anticipation makes stuff seem natural and realistic
    and helps the animation blend in.

    Overall i thought the article was interesting. Interesting in how it is still 
    heavily used used and reffered to in a world of things constantly changing. I personally
    favored the Squah and Strecth and Anticipation but there is something in all the other 10
    principles aside from those two that make each principle special.
