    <h1>Aureia Harvey Interveiw Response</h1>

    <p class="b1">In the reading Aureia Harvey + the Future of Digital Sculpture,
        Aureia talks about her involvment with art and it being through
        the web and digital world. Similar to The History of Net art reading 
        which i feel like is a more general overveiw of the digital world
        and net art Aureria gives us a actual webartist perspective which
        i feel is a bonus. Aureria grew up around computers and from early on 
        was messing around with computers even when it was not really Something
        girls at her time would do. Through web art she was able to express herself
        in many ways while also reaching people all around and connect with people 
        just like her. I feel Aureia trys to get people to embrace digital art because
        all artist use it today in some form.This image Aureia speaks of as her avatar.
